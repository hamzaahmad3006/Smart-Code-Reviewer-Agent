**Project:** Smart Code Reviewer Agent  
**Prepared by:** Hamza  
**Date:** 16 Jan 2026  

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Build a Smart Code Reviewer Agent that analyzes code snippets and provides feedback similar to a senior software engineer. The agent should:  
- Identify code issues  
- Suggest improvements  
- Assign an overall quality score (0–10)  
- Focus on reasoning, judgment, and clear explanation rather than execution  

**Scope:**  
- Support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
- Integration with LLM (OpenAI GPT-4 / LangChain / LangGraph)  
- Web interface built with Next.js (React)  
- Backend API using FastAPI (Python)  

---

## 2. Features & Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Code Input
- Users can paste/write code in a textarea / code editor  
- Language selection dropdown (JS / TS / Python)  
- Submit button triggers the review process  

### 2.2 LLM Code Analysis
- Backend builds prompt for LLM  
- LLM analyzes code:
  - Readability  
  - Structure  
  - Logic  
  - Edge cases  
- Detects:
  - Bugs  
  - Anti-patterns  
  - Potential issues  

### 2.3 Suggestions
- Provides practical suggestions:
  - Refactoring  
  - Best-practice improvements  
- Optional code examples in suggestions  

### 2.4 Scoring System
- Assign 0–10 score with justification  
- Score criteria:
  - 0–3 → Risky / Poor code  
  - 4–6 → Functional but improvable  
  - 7–8 → Good quality  
  - 9–10 → Excellent / Clean code  

### 2.5 Output / UI
- Display in structured format:
  - Score  
  - Issues (bulleted list)  
  - Suggestions (bulleted list)  
  - Reason / justification  
- Optional enhancements:
  - Syntax highlighting  
  - Collapsible sections for Issues/Suggestions  
  - Session history / previous reviews  
  - Loading spinner during LLM response  

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Responsiveness: UI must work on desktop & mobile  
- Performance: LLM response latency < 5 sec per code snippet  
- Security:  
  - No code execution on server  
  - Only safe prompts sent to LLM  
- Scalability: Backend should handle multiple simultaneous requests  
- Maintainability:  
  - Modular React components  
  - Well-documented backend code  

---

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Frontend
- Framework: Next.js (React)  
- Components:
  - LanguageSelect  
  - CodeInput  
  - ReviewOutput  
- Features:
  - Submit button triggers API call  
  - Displays structured review output  
  - Optional: syntax highlighting, dark mode, history  

### 4.2 Backend
- Framework: FastAPI (Python)  
- Features:
  - Accept POST request: `{code, language}`  
  - Build structured prompt for LLM  
  - Send request to LLM  
  - Return JSON response to frontend  

### 4.3 LLM Integration
- Model: GPT-4 / OpenAI / LangChain  
- Functionality:
  - Code reasoning & review  
  - Structured output: `{score, issues, suggestions, reason}`  
- Controlled via prompt engineering, no model training required  

---

## 5. Data / Memory Management

- Session Memory: optional  
  - Store previous reviews in frontend state / localStorage  
  - Helps track progress for same code snippet  
- Scoring Rules: stored in backend config  
- No persistent model training required  

---

## 6. Deliverables

1. GitHub Repository
   - Frontend (Next.js)  
   - Backend (FastAPI)  
   - Example code snippets + review outputs  
   - README / Documentation  

2. Demo Walkthrough
   - Loom video explaining:  
     - How code is submitted  
     - LLM analysis flow  
     - Scoring rationale  

---

## 7. Tools / Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technology                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS       |
| Backend          | Python, FastAPI                    |
| LLM / AI         | OpenAI GPT-4 / LangChain / LangGraph |
| Styling          | Tailwind CSS                       |
| Deployment       | Vercel (Frontend), Any Python server / Render / Railway (Backend) |

---

## 8. Optional Enhancements

- Syntax highlighting in code input / output  
- Collapsible sections for long issue/suggestion lists  
- Dark mode toggle  
- User session history / previous code reviews  
- Export review to PDF  

---

## 9. Testing & QA

- Test with clean code → should give high score  
- Test with intentionally flawed code → should detect issues  
- Ensure score is consistent across runs  
- Validate suggestions are practical & readable  
- Remove debug logs before final submission  

---

## 10. Summary

This project combines **AI reasoning with frontend UX and backend orchestration**.  
The complexity lies in:
- Designing structured prompts for LLM  
- Consistent scoring & explanation  
- Frontend visualization of review results  
- Optional: session memory & advanced UX  

Goal: Create a tool that **feels like a senior developer reviewing code**, not just running static checks.
